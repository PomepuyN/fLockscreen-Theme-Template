\f0\fs24 \cf0 Read me for fLockscreen Theme Template Beta V0.9\
\
This theme template in incomplete,\
there isn't any mdpi or ldpi drawables\
\
there isn't and landscape drawables.\
the teme_preview file is also missing, all these things will be addressed in the next version\
just wanted to get something out for you themes to play with.\
\
First off All image in this template are copyright Eliot Stocker and Ander Webb please do not use any of the images contained in your theme.\
\
Most of the images are pretty obvious so i will just explain the theme_config.xml file in res/values\
\
First off is just the theme name and description just like ADW.\
\
after that is all the colors for the theme, they are done per box, so for instance the value network_text_color changes the color for the network name and the battery color as they re both in one box.\
\
after all the colors there is a number of booleans where you can set some preferences.\
\
background_slide is probably the most important value, this tells the background image (if you choose to use one) how to apply. if background slide is set to true then the background image will go beyond the edges of the screen, and the whole image will slide left to right. if false then the background image will remain within the screen and the elements inside of it will silde.\
if your still not sure then have a play.\
\
allow_art_slide is very simple, you choose weather to allow the art to slide when the screen is moved. the only consideration is that if you wish to use a background image, with allow_art_slide true it will be within the background image, however with false it will be behind the background image.\
\
show_icons allows you to decide weather you display icons next to the sms, gmail and missed call notifications. thats about the size of it.\
\
the final boolean is simple_text_notifs this will simply set the option "Use Short Notifications" to on by default.\
\
The final two values are simply some padding for a couple of the elements.\
\
music_control_pad will change the padding at the bottom of the Music control bar, for instance if you set this to 0dp it will be right at the bottom of the view.\
\
text_notif_pad sets the padding above the sms, gmail and missed call notifications. this allows you to change the network box background to whatever you like and not have problems with stuff over lapping.\
\
The final thing to say, is that you may add a font into the assets directory buy calling it themfont.ttf\
\
We will add more to this template as things progress. so please keep an eye on this.}
